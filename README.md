# comp333-hw1
This site was designed and published as part of the COMP 333 Software Engineering class at Wesleyan University. The described platform is not publicly available but rather is created as a training exercise. I used the Freelancer Bootstrap theme (https://startbootstrap.com/theme/freelancer) and made changes to the style (colors of texts, backgrounds, hovers), the portfolio section (renaming it features) as well as removing the modals, but using Bootstraps grid system for texts. There are some other content changes that are evident when comparing my site to the theme (linked above)
